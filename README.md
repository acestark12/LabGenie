## LabGenie - A Medical Lab Report Decoder App
This project focuses on leveraging advanced language models, particularly Large Language Models (LLM), to enhance patient understanding of intricate medical reports. It aims to automatically generate simplified and accessible summaries using a system called Langchain. The proposed approach utilizes the capabilities of LLM, trained extensively on medical literature and language structures, to analyze and comprehend detailed medical reports. Through natural language processing techniques, the model extracts crucial information including diagnoses, treatment plans, and significant findings. This system prioritizes the security, integrity, and traceability of the generated summaries.
The workflow begins with the extraction of relevant information from medical reports, followed by the utilization of the LLM to understand and interpret the content. Patients can access their summarized medical reports through a user-friendly interface, promoting better understanding of their health status and facilitating informed decision-making.
